== Description ==

PlanetG is your basic building block for creating beautiful, responsive custom themes. It's not a convoluted or confusing framework that's hard to learn or
even harder to modify. It's a simple and elegant starter theme built on HTML5 & CSS3. It's based on the Underscores (_s) and TwentyTwelve themes, so that
means not only is it flexible, it's extremely easy to customise. There's no need to make a child theme (unless you really want to), just dig in to the
code & use it to give yourself a kickstart in creating your next awesome theme.

Its base is a responsive, 12 column grid. It uses Normalize to make sure that browsers render all elements more consistently and Mordernizr for
detecting HTML5 and CSS3 browser capabilities along with some default stylings from HTML5 Boilerplate.

It incorporates the [Options Framework](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-theme/) by Devin Price to make it super easy to add custom Theme Options
as well as the gorgeous [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon font by Dave Gandy.

The main navigation uses the standard WordPress menu. Support for dropdown menus is inluded by default. If you'd like to envoke a button toggle for the main navigation menu on small screens, simply uncomment the two lines from the planetg_scripts_styles() function within functions.php to register and enqueue the necessary javascript file, and BAM! You're done!

Templates

PlanetG includes a set of your most common theme templates, including templates for Full-Width pages, Left Sidebar, Right Sidebar (default), Front-Page, Tag,
Categories, Authors, Search, Posts Archive and 404.

Post Formats

All the standard WordPress Post Formats are supported. These include; Aside, Gallery, Link, Image, Quote, Status, Video, Audio, Chat and of course, 
your standard post.

Widgets

Widgets are a great way of adding extra content to your site and PlanetG has a whole assortment of them.

Main Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on posts and pages except the optional Homepage template, which has its own widgets
Blog Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on the blog and archive pages only
Single Post Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on single posts only
Page Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on pages only

The Front Page Banner Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to two of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you 
only add widgets into the First Front Page Banner Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to both Front 
Page Banner Widget areas, they'll magically space themselves out over two equal columns.
First Front Page Banner Widget: Appears in the banner area on the Front Page
Second Front Page Banner Widget: Appears in the banner area on the Front Page

The Front Page Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to four of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add 
widgets into the First Front Page Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to all four Front Page Widget 
Areas, they'll magically space themselves out over four equal columns.
First Homepage Widget Area: Appears when using the optional homepage template with a page set as Static Front Page
Second Homepage Widget Area: Appears when using the optional homepage template with a page set as Static Front Page
Third Homepage Widget Area: Appears when using the optional homepage template with a page set as Static Front Page
Fourth Homepage Widget Area: Appears when using the optional homepage template with a page set as Static Front Page

The Footer Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to four of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add 
widgets into the First Footer Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to all four Footer Widget Areas, 
they'll magically space themselves out over four equal columns.
First Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
Second Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
Third Footer Widget Area: Appears in the footer sidebar
